# findScreenShot

# Story behind it
I was scrolling tiktok and I came across this website https://prnt.sc/ where you could try to guess a combination of two letters along with 4 numbers to find a random screenshot.
Although this was fun, there were multiple instances where you never got a screenshot as the url combination was not valid. I decided to then try to make a program that solved this by making a program that found valid url's and displayed the actual image
